/* A GRAPH IS SAID TO BE BIPARTITE IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO DIVIDE ALL THE VERTICES INTO 2 MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE SETS SUCH THAT ALL THE EDGES LIE ACCROSS THE SETS. 

IF A GRAPH IS 
A) ACYCLIC, IT IS BIPARTITE
B) CYCLIC AND HAS CYCLE OF EVEN SIZE, IT IS BIPARTITE
C) CYCLIC AND HAS CYCLE OF ODD SIZE, IT IS not BIPARTITE

striver: A BIPARTITE GRAPH CAN BE COLOURED USING 2 COLOURS SUCH THAT NO TWO ADJACENT NODES HAVE THE SAME COLOUR
