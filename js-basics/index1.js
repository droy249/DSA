// Every statement in JavaScript should end with ';'

/*

    A variable can be declared using both 'var' and 'let'
    keywords. But it is recommended to use 'let' instead of
    'var'

// Types of primitive variables in Javascript:

let name = 'Mosh';
// string Literal
// Declared using either single quotes('') or double quotes("")
// Generally '' are prefered over ""

let age = 30;
// number Literal
// In JavaScript, there is no integer, floating-point etc.
// Only numbers

let isApproved = true
// boolean literal
// Either true or false

let truth = undefined;
// undefined variable
// Could be also written as "let truth;"
// Since JavaScript is dynamically-typed, its variables are by
// default undefined, i.e. could be anything - number, string, 
// object, boolean, null etc.

let goodness = null;
// object literal
